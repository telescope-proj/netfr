# Network Frame Relay Protocol

NetFR is a custom protocol for uncompressed, low-latency video transmission over
fast local networks. It is tightly mapped to Looking Glass semantics, minimizing
the level of abstraction required. 

NetFR/TCM is the continuation of the legacy Telescope Remote Framebuffer Library
(libtrf), and uses libraries compatible across all major operating systems
(although currently only Linux is supported).
